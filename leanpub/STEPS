Steps to convert the Leanpub Markdown source files (created by the
HTML importer, feeding it the chunked HTML version produced by a2x,
and sitting under manuscript-auto-converted/) into a final, refined
version that can be used as Leanpub sources to get a final book:

* Fix Book.txt (order and which files, and remove index.txt)
* Make sure all source code blocks begin with " __" (first two in
  ch04.txt need fixing)
* Remove the emphasis in titles ("^__Mal_" in ch04.txt and ch06.txt)
* Run "./convert.pl manuscript-auto-converted manuscript convert_done"

Now the sources under manuscript/ are ready to compile.
